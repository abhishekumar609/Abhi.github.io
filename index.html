       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">he status of women in India has been subject to many changes over the span of 
        recorded Indian history. Their position in society deteriorated early in India's ancient period,
        especially in the Indo-Aryan speaking regions, and their subordination continued
        to be reified well into India's early modern period. During the British East India Company rule (1757–1857),
        and the British Raj (1858–1947),measures aiming at amelioration were enacted,
        including Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829, Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act,
        1870, and Age of Consent Act,1891. Women's rights under the Constitution of India mainly include equality, dignity, 
        and freedom from discrimination; additionally, India has various statutes governing the rights of women.
        Several women have served in various senior official positions in the Indian government,
        including that of the President of India, the Prime Minister of India, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
        However, many women in India continue to face significant difficulties.
        The rates of malnutrition are exceptionally high among adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women in India,
        with repercussions for children's health.
        Violence against women,especially sexual violence, is a serious concern in India </p>
